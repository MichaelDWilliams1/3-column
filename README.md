This a small fun project challenge from the frontend mentor website. This is my solution to the challenge.
I built this in HTML and CSS.
I used flexbox to get the content where i wanted it.
I only has to use one media query to make this mobile repsonisve. 
Cannot say learned much but i did have fun completing this challenge!
