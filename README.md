This a small fun project challenge from the frontend mentor website. This is my solution to the challenge. <br>
I built this in HTML and CSS. <br>
I used flexbox to get the content where i wanted it. <br>
I only had to use one media query to make this mobile repsonisve. <br>
Cannot say learned much but i did have fun completing this challenge! <br>
